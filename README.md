# Bill-Spliting


This is a bill splitting app I tried to develop for the task by CareStack. I started with designing the database first by considering all the different cases of the problem statement using Django. To be specific ORM prototype was used(Object Relational Mapping). Followed by creation of the database I created a corresponding serializer, that does serialization/deserialization  to convert an object to json and vice-versa. After creation of serializer, I started creating views which are different endpoints which on selecting updates the database making use of serializers.
